## Dataset Overview
This dataset is drawn from the **China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2014** and contains information on **regional, urban/rural distinctions, parental presence, and child health conditions**. The CFPS dataset provides nationally representative longitudinal data on family and individual dynamics in China.

## Purpose
The dataset is designed for research in:
- **Social sciences**: Understanding how urban vs. rural settings impact child health.
- **Parental impact analysis**: Studying how the presence or absence of parents affects a child's well-being.
- **NLP-based interpretability**: Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text-based factors related to parental care and child health outcomes.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed any missing or inconsistent values.
   - Standardized text formats (e.g., region names, categorical values).

2. **Encoding**:
   - Converted categorical variables (e.g., ‘父亲是否缺失’, ‘母亲是否缺失’, ‘孩子是否生病’) into numerical values for NLP and visualization.
   - Used Label Encoding to transform text-based data into a structured numerical format.

3. **Data Harmonization**:
   - Unified different regional naming conventions (e.g., ‘Eastern region’ vs. ‘Easternern region’).
   - Mapped urban/rural distinctions under a single categorization scheme.
   - Ensured consistent representation of parental presence and child health conditions.

## Visualization & NLP-Based Interpretability
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP** to visualize text embeddings.
- **BERT-based NLP Analysis**: Extracted textual relationships and encoded them for deeper interpretability.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Used **DBSCAN** to group similar data points and detect trends in child health outcomes.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identifying patterns in parental involvement and child health based on location.
- Establishing a connection between urban/rural status and child well-being.
- Leveraging NLP for explainable results and better interpretability.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding dataset size for better generalizability.
- Incorporating additional socio-economic indicators.
- Applying advanced NLP models for improved text representation.
